World in a Pen
Once I went looking for the world,
only it wasn't in.

There was only me, behind a barred door,
staring and not answering.

No key, no reply, nothing to say,
no idea what to say.

The next day,
hidden under the door mat,
on a folded piece of notebook paper,

I found the answer.

No, no I didn't,
Well one can dream!
